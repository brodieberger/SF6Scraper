# SF6Scraper
(Future) Open source web application for scraping and displaying Street Fighter 6 profile data from streetfighter.com/6/buckler/.

Plans are to make it display interesting statistics about a chosen player's MR. Including MR history shown with a line graph, MR win loss ratio against each character, ect...

As of right now, this project is very unfinished. But you can try running it yourself, or click [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1449e8f-551d-4486-a277-01d8601f21fc) for a demo!
